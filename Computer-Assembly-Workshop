💻 My First Hands-On Experience with Computer Assembly

Today, I had the opportunity to attend a workshop on computer component assembly and disassembly. It was my first time working directly with the internal parts of a computer — something I’ve always been curious about. This experience helped me understand not just the names of the components, but also their functions and how they work together to make a system come alive.



🧩 Components I Learned About

1. Motherboard
The motherboard is the main circuit board — it acts like the nervous system of the computer, connecting all components together. It provides the communication pathway between the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and other peripherals.

2. RAM (Random Access Memory)
RAM temporarily stores data and instructions that the CPU needs while performing tasks. It’s one of the main factors that affect the speed and performance of a computer.

3. Hard Disk / SSD (Storage Device)
The hard disk or SSD is where all files, software, and the operating system are stored permanently. SSDs are faster and more reliable compared to traditional HDDs.

4. Power Supply Unit (PSU)
The PSU converts electrical power from the wall outlet into the correct voltage for the computer’s components. Without it, the entire system cannot operate.

5. Cooling Fan
The cooling fan helps regulate the temperature inside the casing. It prevents components like the CPU and GPU from overheating, which can cause damage or reduced performance.

6. Various Cables
Cables are the veins of the system — they deliver data and power between components. Examples include SATA cables for storage and power cables for the motherboard and peripherals.




🛠️ The Disassembly Process

During the workshop, I learned how to carefully remove each component in the correct order:

1. Remove the casing cover

Open the side panel of the computer to access internal parts.

2. Unplug all cables

Disconnect data and power cables to avoid damage when removing parts.

3. Remove the power supply unit (PSU)

Unscrew and take out the PSU from its compartment.

4. Remove the RAM modules

Unlock the side clips and gently lift the RAM sticks from their slots.

5. Remove the hard disk / SSD

Detach it from the storage bay and disconnect the SATA cables.

6. Remove the cooling fan

Unscrew and lift it off carefully, avoiding contact with the motherboard.



🔄 The Reassembly and Testing

After disassembly, I reassembled all components step by step — connecting each cable, reattaching the PSU, inserting RAM and storage, and closing the casing. Finally, we connected the system to a power source to test if everything was installed correctly. Watching the system power up successfully gave me a real sense of achievement!




💡 Reflection

This workshop gave me a deeper appreciation of how hardware and software depend on each other. It wasn’t just about plugging parts together — it was about understanding how a computer breathes.
As a data engineering student, this knowledge strengthens my foundation in computer architecture and helps me appreciate the physical layer behind every digital system we design or work with.

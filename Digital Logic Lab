🔧 Digital Logic Lab — 17 November 2025

Today’s Digital Logic Lab was a quiet reminder that every complex system begins with something simple — a gate, a switch, a single line of truth in a table.

I spent the day wiring circuits, testing outputs, and watching LEDs respond to every choice of input. AND, OR, NAND — the fundamentals that shape everything behind our modern world.
There’s a certain beauty in seeing logic come alive physically, one connection at a time.

Step by step, I’m learning to think more clearly, build more carefully, and understand the foundations that future technology stands on.

A small lab session, but another step forward.
